      <h1>Photo Stories â€“ Flow</h1>
      <p>
        Photo Stories is a concept feature for Facebook. It is a new feed which
        replaces the news feed and converts status updates, check-ins, and photo
        uploads into beautiful stories. This is to bring travellers, photographers and people
        who love Instagram to Facebook.

        Photo Stories are created automatically and they don't require any user input.
        It grabs a series of posts made by a user including photo uploads,
        check-ins, status updates and creates a story out of them in that order.
      </p>
      <p>
        A summary of initial location used in the check-in is pulled from
        Wikipedia and displayed at the top of story. Apart from that, the photos
        are also arranged smartly. The photos with the most likes take up the whole
        row while others are divided into two/three columns.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            For introduction, a tooltip is shown to the users who are currently
            on the news feed following these rules:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The tooltip is shown with an overlay over the content. Tapping on
              either the tooltip or the overlay dismisses the tooltip.
            </li>
            <li>
              Long pressing the news feed icon brings up a menu (slide in from
              bottom), replacing the icon with a cross button.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tapping the "Photo Stories" menu item takes the user to the "Photo
              Stories" feed.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>The same process is repeated if the user wants to switch back to the news feed.</p>

          <h2>Photo Story Feed</h2>

          <p>
            Photo Stories feed shows a concise version of actual photo stories.
            It consists of a cover image, a horizontally scrollable section of
            all the photos/videos and an action bar.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name of the person is shown on top of the cover image, along
            with the time of the last update and the first status/check-in message
            of the story.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clicking on the cover photo takes the user to the photo story detail.
            Clicking on the photos below will open the default fullscreen photo view.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flow__image">

          <h2>Photo Story Detail</h2>

          <p>
            Everything except the cover image fades away when transitioning from
            feed to the detailed story. The cover image then repositions to its
            new position in the story and the remaining information fades in
            sequentially.
